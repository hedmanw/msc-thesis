\chapter{Results}
The findings from the internal evaluation, dealing only with completeness, correctness and efficiency is:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The intentions suffice for performing common integration tasks. Often just using \textit{Keep} and \textit{Remove} resolve the task.
    \item When intentions are correctly declared, then our proposed resolutions of the intentions and their actual implementations produce a correctly integrated configurable platform.
    \item Substantially fewer operations are required when using intentions, compared to the operations required when using an ordinary merge tool.
\end{itemize}
